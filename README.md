## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Implementing a unique structured grid layout for testimonials using CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Enhancing user experience with hover effects and interactive elements
- Ensuring responsiveness for optimal viewing across various screen sizes

This project simply requires basic understanding of concept of grid-box to make the design to website successfully and can be a beginner's first project. Following snippet shows one such implementation-

```css
/* individual card styling */
.card {
    grid-area: card;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    background: #733FC8;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 2em 1.75em;
    margin: 1em;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 45px auto;
    grid-template-rows: 16px 16px auto minmax(auto, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas:
        "img name"
        "img title"
        "main-quote main-quote"
        "testimonial testimonial";
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
